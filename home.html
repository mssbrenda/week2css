    <h2>Our story</h2>

    <!--A brief description about it's history-->

    <p class="home-story">
      JJ's Pizzeria," a family-owned gem renowned for its inventive pizza
      flavors. The heart of this beloved establishment was the trio of siblings:
      Antonio, Sofia, and Marco. Antonio was a master of dough, tossing it with
      graceful flair. Sofia was the flavor artist, experimenting with exciting
      toppings. Marco, the friendly face of the pizzeria, welcomed guests with a
      warm smile and a joke. When a crisis struck, and they had to take charge,
      they rallied their unique talents. The community rallied behind them,
      drawn by the allure of Mia's innovative pizza creations. With dedication
      and love, the siblings not only upheld the pizzeria's reputation but
      enhanced it, proving that the key ingredient was always the passion they
      poured into every mouthwatering slice.
